# Paper Stencil
A starter kit (heavily inspired by the Polymer Starter Kit) with some Material Design like elements baked in.

## Getting started
Install this project into your own:

```bash
# feel free to use npm instead
yarn add dustinwtf/paper-stencil
```
Then add this to your collection in your `stencil.config.js`:
```js
{ collections: [
    { name: '@stencil/router' },
    { name: 'paper-stencil' } // <-- this one right here
]}
```
